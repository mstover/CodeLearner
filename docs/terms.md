### Interface

An interface is a collection of [methods](#method) that must be implemented by any class that "implements" the interface.
It is like a promise to any code that receives your class, that they can call any of those methods on
your class. 

### Method

A *method* is a a chunk of code that can be called on an [object](#class), using the syntax `<obj>.<method>()`, 
where `<obj>` is some value you have of a type (an interface, or class), and `<method>` is the name of the method 
being called.  Some methods can be passed parameters.

### Property
A *property* is like a method, but it's just a value that an object holds.  Sometimes they are private
and cannot be accessed by external classes, but sometimes they are public, such as `string.length` and
can be accessed directly.  You can't pass a parameter though - it's not a method that does anything, it's 
just a value that can be retrieved.

### Class

Classes and Objects are the heart and soul of Object-Oriented programming.  Typescript is an Object-Oriented
programming language.  Your code describes *classes* and the methods one can call on those classes.  For
instance, there is a built-in class called `string`, which holds a list of characters, such as "house".  
Actually, the *class* doesn't hold any characters.  It describes what **objects** of *type* **class** can do.
So, if I create an object of type `string`, ie 
```$xslt
var obj:string = "house";
```

Then this means I have a value, a variable, named "obj", which is of type `string` and holds the value 
"house".  The class `string` defines a property called `length` that I can call on it, and if I call `obj.length` 
here, I will get the answer **5**.

### Variables
Variables are named instances in your code that hold values.  A value can be any simple value (like
a number, or a boolean, which is a value that can either be **true** or **false**, or an object).  Variables
in different places sometimes get called different names - a value passed to a method is often called
a "parameter".  A value declared in the scope of a method is usually called a variable.  A value declared
as belonging to a class, like:

```$xslt
class Example {
   myVariable:string = "house";
   
   getMyVariable() {
      returns this.house;
   }
}

var a = new Example();
console.log("Hey, a.myVariable = " + a.myVariable);
```
this will print "Hey, a.myVariagble = house".  These kinds of variables are sometimes called "fields", or
"instance members", because they are fields or members of a particular object, which is an instance of a 
class.

When using a field of a class within the code of that class, you must prefix your access to it with "this.".  So
`this.myVariable`.  Never just `myVariable`.  This is something of a *typescript* quirk - many other Object-Oriented
languages take the "this." as implicit.

### Declaring vs Defining
These two words can easily be confused, but when we talk about a method being *declared* vs being *defined*, we mean
the difference between an interface, which *declares* methods, but doesn't provide any code for how that
method works, and a class, which *defines* methods, and provides curly braces {} between which you will
find the code that says, "do this, then do that, and finally return this result".  

Why would we ever want to just declare a method??  Ah, well, this is the kind of thing you'll be learning 
in the coming weeks and months.  You could write all your code with no interfaces, everything "concrete" classes 
as we say, but I think eventually you will find you wished you had some interfaces!  It's not a concept I 
can just give you, you will have to see for yourself, the power of the interface.  However, you will note that
even Lesson One of the CodeLearner project defines some interfaces that make it easier for you to jump right
in.

### Comments in Code
In your files that hold code, you can write comments that the computer (the compiler, the interpreter)
will ignore.  These comments are for people to read to help understand the code.  For Typescript,
the two slashes, like ```//``` indicates the rest of that line is a comment.  For a larger, multiline
comment, we use ```/* Here is a big comment, many many lines */```.  The comment begins and ends with 
the combo  of / and *.

Sometimes we "comment out" lines of code so that they will not be run, but if we ever do want them
to run, all we have to do is removed the ```//``` at the start of the line.

### Conditionals
A conditional is some code that evaluates to a boolean value.  A boolean value is a value
that is either true or false.  A simple conditional expression is:

```3 > 0```

which evaluates to true.  Another:

```a == b```

which evaluates to true if a is equal to b, and false otherwise.  

### Compile
Compiling code is the process of converting the "source" code, which is what you write, into a form 
the computer can understand.  When code doesn't "compile", it means this translation process
failed due to some issue with your source code.

### Import
Importing means referring to code that lies in other files or somewhere else other than the current
source file.  Different programming languages have different ways of importing external code.  Without
importing, the compiler doesn't know where to get these external classes and resources, and the 
compiler will generally not make many assumptions about where to find files, so you need to specify.

### What Is An Array
An array is like a list of objects, or values.  You can have a list of string values - 
```string[]```, or a list of number values - ```number[]```, or a list of any kind of value
you like.  "Kind of value" essentially means "type".  So you can have a list of any type - 
```Teacher[]```, or ```MySolution[]```.  

An array in Typescript can grow, be added to, you can remove values from it, you count them,
you can [iterate](#iteration) over them, etc.  If you have an array with no elements in it:

```var myArray: string[] = [];```

Then you can add elements like so: 

```
   myArray[0] = "Hello";
   myArray[1] = " ";
   myArray[2] = "World"
```

And now your array, printed to the console, looks like:

```
[ "Hello", " ", "World"]
```

It has three element, with indices of 0, 1, and 2.  As with most things in computing, counting
starts at zero.  Something to note about that is that you can thus add new elements to the
end of a list easily:

```
myArray: string[] = [];
myArray[myArray.length] = "Hello";
myArray[myArray.length] = " ";
myArray[myArray.length] = "World";
```
In the first line, we create the array with no elements.  In the second line, the 
length of the array is 0, and we set the value of the 0-th element to "Hello".  The 0-th
element doesn't exist when we do that, but Typescript automatically expands the array to have
one element, initially empty, into which we put the value "Hello".  

Then in line 3, the length is 1, and in line 4, the length is 2, and after line 4
the length of the array is 3.  If counting started at 1, this would not work (we would have
to make it read ```myArray[myArray.length+1] = "blah blah";```).
You will note you can do math inside the square brackets to calculate an index value.
